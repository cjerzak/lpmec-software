Description: Implements methods for analyzing latent variable models with measurement
    error correction, including Item Response Theory (IRT) models. Provides tools for
    various correction methods such as Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
    over-imputation, bootstrapping for robust standard errors, Ordinary Least Squares
    (OLS), and Instrumental Variables (IV) based approaches. Supports flexible
    specification of observable indicators and groupings for latent variable analyses
    in social sciences and other fields. Methods are described in a working paper
    (2025) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2507.22218>.
